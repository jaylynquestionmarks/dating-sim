    doc "Our team here was debating whether it was a stack overflow but you didn't show any signs of internal spasming, so we're not exactly sure."
    player "{i}A stack overflow? How does that happen to a person??{/i}"
    doc "From your medical record, it looks like it's been a recurring issue."
    doc "Apparently you're an intern at a branch of the AP CSA? That's Agent Patil's Corporation of Secent Agents, in case your memory's still spotty."
    doc "They've decided they want to keep you under their watch, so they're...putting you on the main team???"
    doc "That makes no sense. But unfortunately, it's a nonnegotiable order."
    player "..."
    player "What."
